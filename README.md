Nostalgia Games - Street Rider
==============================

The object of the game is to score as many points as you can. You earn points by bunnyhopping over obstacles. Small Ramps jump you 1 space, while big ramps jump you 3 spaces.

Use the up and down arrow keys to change lanes, the right arrow key to start moving, and the space bar to jump.
